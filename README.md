## 🌍 Social Impact & SDG Alignment

This project addresses real-world humanitarian needs and supports multiple **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**

- ✅ **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**  
  Prevents drowning fatalities through faster underwater detection in rescue operations.

- ✅ **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**  
  Adaptable for underwater inspection of water bodies to support environmental monitoring.

- ✅ **SDG 13: Climate Action**  
  Contributes to climate resilience through flood/disaster recovery and mitigation tools.

> 🎯 This is a high-impact **social innovation project** driven by sustainability, safety, and community well-being.
